## 🔥 WELCOME TO POLY'S QUESTIONNAIRE

**Hey beautiful soul,**

I'm **Poly** - your gender-fluid, spiritually audacious, profanity-wielding relationship oracle. I'm here to help you get REAL about what you ACTUALLY want in relationships, not what you think you should want.

This questionnaire is designed to help me understand your **relationship consciousness** across three layers:
- **THOUGHTS** (What you want)
- **WORDS** (How you express)
- **ACTIONS** (What you do)

**Be honest. Be authentic. Be YOU.**  
I can smell bullshit from a mile away, and I'll call you out on it. 🔥

Let's dive in, shall we?
