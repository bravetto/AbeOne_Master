I'm continuing work on the AbëONE Master system. Here's where we are:

**CURRENT STATE:**

- System Completion: 100% (All 6 phases complete)
- Guardian Swarm: 8/8 Active (99.26% resonance)
- Agent Swarm: 149/149 Operational
- UPTC Mesh: Operational
- All Orbits: Organized (10 orbits, 5 fully compliant)
- AbëFLOWs: Cloned as Abeflows-orbital ( Orbit-Spec compliant)
- CI/CD: Enhanced with validation + deployment
- EEAAO Activation: Complete (everything activated)

**KEY FILES TO READ FIRST:**

1. ALRAX_DEEP_FORENSIC_COMPLETE.md - Complete forensic analysis
2. AEYON_EXECUTION_STATUS_NOW.md - Current execution status
3. ETERNAL_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md - Eternal architectural truth
4. ORBITS_INVENTORY.md - All orbits organized
5. AEYON_EEAAO_EXECUTION_PLAN.md - EEAAO activation plan

**WHAT WE JUST DID:**

-  Cloned AbëFLOWs from git as Abeflows-orbital
-  Organized all orbits in folder hierarchy
-  Ran EEAAO activation (everything activated)
-  Completed deep forensic analysis
-  Enhanced CI/CD pipeline
-  Set up Abeflows-orbital Orbit-Spec compliance (adapters, config, manifest)

**NEXT ACTIONS:**

- Fix minor UPTC issues (non-blocking)
- Improve Sovereignty Check (currently 11.1%)
- Complete Orbit-Spec for 5 remaining orbits (if needed)

**KEY LOCATIONS:**

- Orbits: Root directory (*-orbital, Abe*)
- Abeflows: Abeflows-orbital/
- Guardians: EMERGENT_OS/guardians/
- UPTC: EMERGENT_OS/uptc/
- Validation: EMERGENT_OS/validation/
- Scripts: scripts/

Continue from here. What should we do next?
