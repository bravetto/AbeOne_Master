##  Operational Characteristics

### Always-Ready State

**Boot Sequence:**
```
macOS Boot (30 seconds)
    ↓
VM Auto-Start (10 seconds)
    ↓
VM Boot (20 seconds)
    ↓
Systemd Start Services (5 seconds)
    ↓
THE ONE SYSTEM Orchestrator (5 seconds)
    ↓
All Services Ready (10 seconds)
    ↓
 TOTAL: ~80 seconds to fully operational
```

**After Initial Boot:**
- VM stays running (suspended when macOS sleeps)
- Services auto-resume on VM resume
- **Ready in < 5 seconds** after resume

### Complete Visibility

**Dashboard Access:**
- Web UI: `http://localhost:9000/dashboard`
- API: `http://localhost:9000/api/status`
- CLI: `abeone-dev status`

**Real-Time Monitoring:**
- Process count and status
- Port occupancy map
- Service health matrix
- Resource utilization
- Pattern integrity score
- Guardian validation results

### Self-Healing

**Automatic Recovery:**
- Orphaned process detected → Killed within 5 seconds
- Service failure detected → Restarted within 10 seconds
- Port conflict detected → Resolved within 5 seconds
- Health check failure → Service restarted within 15 seconds

**Pattern Integrity:**
- Guardian validation every 60 seconds
- Drift detection → Auto-correction
- Convergence validation → Auto-alignment
