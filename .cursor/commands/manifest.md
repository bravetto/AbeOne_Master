# manifest

Make things real from patterns! Like magic - turn ideas into real code!

Usage:
/manifest [action] [target] [options]

Actions:
- materialize — Make something real from patterns (like building from a blueprint)
- collapse — Make potential into reality (like making dreams come true)
- generate — Make something from patterns (like 3D printing from a design)
- transmute — Change one thing into another (like alchemy!)

Target Types:
- component/[name] — React/UI components
- module/[name] — Python/JS modules
- agent/[name] — Agent definitions
- pattern/[name] — Pattern implementations
- swarm/[name] — Swarm configurations
- pipeline/[name] — Pipeline definitions
- orbital/[name] — Orbital system components
- guardian/[name] — Guardian implementations
- hook/[name] — React hooks
- util/[name] — Utility functions
- api/[name] — API endpoints
- workflow/[name] — GitHub workflows
- script/[name] — Shell/Python scripts

Options:
- --from-pattern <pattern> — Use specific pattern
- --validate — Check before making (default: true)
- --dry-run — See what would be made (default: false)
- --force — Overwrite existing (default: false)
- --yagni-check — Only make what's needed (default: true)
- --future-state — Pretend it's already done (default: true)
- --verbose — Show details (default: false)

Examples:

Make a button component:
/manifest materialize component/ui/Button
Like building a button from a blueprint!

Make a module:
/manifest generate module/utils
Like 3D printing a tool!

Make an agent:
/manifest materialize agent/heart-truth
Like bringing a character to life!

See what would be made:
/manifest materialize component/ui/Card --dry-run
Like previewing before building!

Make from specific pattern:
/manifest materialize component/ui/Button --from-pattern ONE-PATTERN
Like using a specific recipe!

Fun Examples:

Build a button:
/manifest materialize component/ui/Button
Like building with LEGO blocks!

Make a tool:
/manifest generate module/calculator
Like making a calculator from a design!

Bring ideas to life:
/manifest collapse pipeline/core
Like making dreams real!

Change things:
/manifest transmute architecture/flow
Like magic transformation!

Simple Explanation:

Manifest is like:
- Building from blueprints
- 3D printing from designs
- Making dreams real
- Magic transformation

When you use /manifest:
- materialize = build from pattern
- collapse = make potential real
- generate = create from design
- transmute = transform

Execution:
python3 scripts/manifest-engine.py [action] [target] [options]

Integration Points:
- ARDM — Detects what to manifest
- Meta Orchestrator — Finds patterns
- Guardians — AEYON (execution), YAGNI (filtering), META (patterns)
- Validators — Checks what's made

Command Priority Execution:
When /manifest is invoked:
1. Action — Execute scripts/manifest-engine.py
2. Pattern Detection — Find patterns to use
3. Validation — Check with YAGNI filter
4. Manifestation — Make it real
5. Report — Show what was made

Commands are not interpreted. They are executed.
