## ✅ OPERATIONALIST MESSAGING

### AWS Auth Pattern ✅ SUCCESS
**Message:**
```
✅ No Kubernetes workflows found (AWS auth not needed)
✅ 3 validation/Cloudflare workflows correctly don't use AWS auth
✅ When K8s workflows are added, they will require IRSA v4 authentication
```

**Why:** Clear, operational, programmatically communicated

---

### Docker Buildx Pattern ✅ SUCCESS
**Message:**
```
✅ No Kubernetes builds found (Buildx not needed)
✅ 3 validation/Cloudflare workflows correctly don't use Buildx
✅ When K8s builds are added, they will require Buildx with Kubernetes driver
```

**Why:** Clear, operational, programmatically communicated

---

### Helm Deployment Pattern ✅ SUCCESS
**Message:**
```
✅ No Kubernetes deployments found (Helm not needed)
✅ Validation/Cloudflare workflows correctly don't use Helm
✅ When K8s deployments are added, they will require Helm charts
```

**Why:** Clear, operational, programmatically communicated

## 📋 VALIDATOR BEHAVIOR

### Before (Non-Operationalist):
- ⚠️ INFO: "No AWS auth steps found"
- ⚠️ INFO: "No builds found"
- ⚠️ INFO: "No deployments found"
- **Score:** 65.0% (misleading)

### After (Operationalist):
- ✅ SUCCESS: "No K8s workflows (AWS auth not needed)" + clear why's
- ✅ SUCCESS: "No K8s builds (Buildx not needed)" + clear why's
- ✅ SUCCESS: "No K8s deployments (Helm not needed)" + clear why's
- **Score:** 91.2% (truthful)
