# converge

Make everything work together perfectly! Like tuning an orchestra so all instruments play in harmony!

Usage:
/converge [workflow]

Workflows:
- validation — Check everything works (like testing all your toys)
- amplification — Make guardians stronger (like leveling up characters)
- synthesis — Make patterns work together (like mixing colors perfectly)
- all — Do everything (like pressing the "make perfect" button)

Examples:

Check everything:
/converge validation
Like testing all your toys to make sure they work!

Make guardians stronger:
/converge amplification
Like leveling up your characters in a game!

Make patterns work together:
/converge synthesis
Like mixing colors to make perfect art!

Do everything:
/converge all
Like pressing the "make everything perfect" button!

Fun Examples:

Test everything:
/converge validation
Like checking your bike before riding!

Level up guardians:
/converge amplification
Like making your team stronger!

Mix patterns perfectly:
/converge synthesis
Like mixing paint colors perfectly!

Make everything perfect:
/converge all
Like magic that fixes everything!

Simple Explanation:

Converge is like:
- Tuning instruments to play together
- Mixing colors to make perfect art
- Leveling up characters in a game
- Testing toys to make sure they work

When you use /converge:
- validation = check everything works
- amplification = make things stronger
- synthesis = make things work together
- all = do everything

Execution:
python3 scripts/converge-engine.py [workflow]

Integration Points:
- Validation System — Checks everything
- Guardian System — Makes guardians stronger
- Pattern System — Makes patterns work together
- Convergence Engine — Makes everything perfect

Command Priority Execution:
When /converge is invoked:
1. Workflow — Execute scripts/converge-engine.py with workflow
2. Convergence — Make everything work together
3. Validation — Check everything works
4. Report — Show what was done
