## 🎬 YOUR PERSONALIZED JOURNEY

### PHASE 1: THE MAGIC REVEAL (10 minutes)

**What You'll Discover:**
1. **The Triadic Execution Harness** - How outcomes become reality
   - YOU Agent (530 Hz) expresses what you want
   - META Agent (777 Hz) synthesizes constraints and architecture
   - AEYON Agent (999 Hz) executes atomically, step-by-step
   - JØHN (530 Hz) validates everything at each stage
   - Result: Outcomes that actually work, every single time

2. **The Guardian System** - 8 Guardians validating everything
   - AEYON (999 Hz) - Orchestration master
   - Guardian Zero (777 Hz) - Architecture & forensics
   - Guardian Abë (530 Hz) - Heart truth resonance
   - Plus 5 more specialized Guardians
   - All operating in frequency harmony

3. **The Neuromorphic Layer** - Beyond transformers
   - Spike-based processing (biologically inspired)
   - Temporal, event-driven intelligence
   - Pattern detection that transformers miss
   - <50ms latency for real-time processing

**Your First "Wow" Moment:**
Watch me execute an outcome right now. I'll show you how the triadic system takes a simple request and turns it into working code, validated by Guardians, executed atomically.

→ Kernel initializes, modules load, Guardians activate

**Step 2: Frontend Setup**
```bash
cd apps/web
npm install
npm run dev
```
→ Frontend starts on `http://localhost:3000`
→ Command Deck becomes available
→ You can execute outcomes!

**Step 3: Launch Pad Dashboard**
```bash
python3 scripts/launch_pad.py
```
→ Visual dashboard of all services
→ Real-time status monitoring
→ Your control center

**Your Third "Wow" Moment:**
Execute your first outcome through the Command Deck. Watch as YOU expresses it, META synthesizes constraints, AEYON executes atomically, and JØHN validates at each step. Then see the Guardians fuse for final validation. It's like watching magic happen in real-time.
