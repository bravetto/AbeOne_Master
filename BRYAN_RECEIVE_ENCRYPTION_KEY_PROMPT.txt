I need to receive and set up the encryption keys for the AbëKEYs system to access marketing automation credentials (SendGrid, Google Ads, Stripe).

**CONTEXT:**
- The encrypted vault `abekeys_vault.encrypted.json` is already in the repository
- I need to receive the encryption key from the team lead to decrypt it
- Once decrypted, I can access credentials via: `python3 scripts/abekeys/abekeys_encrypted.py get sendgrid`

**WHAT I NEED FROM TEAM LEAD:**
1. `vault_key.key` - The Fernet encryption key (or master key)
2. Instructions on how to securely receive it (SSH, Age encryption, or password-protected zip)

**SETUP STEPS:**

1. **Receive the encryption key securely** (from team lead via secure method)
   - Option A: SSH transfer
   - Option B: Age encryption
   - Option C: Password-protected zip file

2. **Save the key to the correct location:**
   ```bash
   # Create .abekeys directory if it doesn't exist
   mkdir -p ~/.abekeys
   
   # Save the encryption key
   # (The team lead will provide the key file - save it as:)
   cp received_key.key ~/.abekeys/vault_key.key
   
   # Set secure permissions
   chmod 600 ~/.abekeys/vault_key.key
   ```

3. **Verify the encrypted vault exists:**
   ```bash
   # Check that encrypted vault is in repository
   ls -la abekeys_vault.encrypted.json
   ```

4. **Test decryption:**
   ```bash
   # Test accessing credentials
   python3 scripts/abekeys/abekeys_encrypted.py get sendgrid
   python3 scripts/abekeys/abekeys_encrypted.py get google_ads
   python3 scripts/abekeys/abekeys_encrypted.py get stripe
   ```

5. **If decryption works, credentials are ready to use!**

**ALTERNATIVE: If team lead uses different key format:**
- If they send `hmac_key.key` and `kdf_salt.key` - these are for a different encryption method
- The current system uses Fernet encryption with a single `vault_key.key`
- Ask team lead to confirm which encryption method they're using

**SECURE TRANSFER OPTIONS (for team lead):**
- SSH: `scp vault_key.key bryan@server:~/.abekeys/`
- Age encryption: Team lead encrypts with Age, Bryan decrypts
- Password-protected zip: Team lead creates zip, shares password separately

**VERIFICATION:**
Once I receive the key and save it, help me:
1. Verify the key file exists and has correct permissions (600)
2. Test decrypting the vault
3. Verify I can access all three credentials (sendgrid, google_ads, stripe)
4. Confirm the credentials are valid and ready to use

Please guide me through receiving the encryption key securely and setting it up correctly. If the team lead is using a different encryption method (hmac_key/kdf_salt), help me understand what needs to be done differently.
