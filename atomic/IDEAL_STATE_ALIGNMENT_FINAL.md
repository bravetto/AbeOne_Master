##  ALIGNMENT ROADMAP

### Phase 1: Foundation (High Priority)

**Goal:** Achieve 70%+ average score

**Actions:**
1. Add TypeScript types to Base UI components (6 components)
   - Impact: +150 points
   - Estimated: 1-2 hours

2. Add forwardRef to components (8 components)
   - Impact: +200 points
   - Estimated: 1-2 hours

**Projected Score:** 59.5% → ~75% 

### Phase 2: Enhancement (Medium Priority)

**Goal:** Achieve 85%+ average score

**Actions:**
1. Add CVA to variant components (10 components)
   - Impact: +50 points
   - Estimated: 2-3 hours

2. Add ICP variants (4 components)
   - Impact: +40 points
   - Estimated: 1-2 hours

**Projected Score:** ~75% → ~85% 

### Phase 3: Perfection (Low Priority)

**Goal:** Achieve 100% average score

**Actions:**
1. Add cn() utility (5 components)
   - Impact: +45 points
   - Estimated: 30 minutes

2. Fine-tune remaining components
   - Impact: +remaining points
   - Estimated: 1-2 hours

**Projected Score:** ~85% → 100%

##  COMPONENT ALIGNMENT STATUS

### Perfect Components (100%) 

1.  `products/apps/web/components/ui/alert.tsx`
2.  `products/apps/web/components/ui/button.tsx`

### Near-Perfect Components (90-99%)

**Atomic Components:**
- Most Atomic components score 60% (have pattern + guardian + types + forwardRef)
- Missing: CVA, ICP variants, cn() utility (optional)

**Base UI Components:**
- Several Base UI components score 75% (have types + forwardRef + CVA)
- Missing: TypeScript types, forwardRef (varies by component)

### Components Needing Enhancement

**High Priority:**
- 6 Base UI components missing TypeScript types
- 8 components missing forwardRef
- 4 Atomic components missing ICP variants

**Medium Priority:**
- 10 components missing CVA for variants
- 5 components missing cn() utility
