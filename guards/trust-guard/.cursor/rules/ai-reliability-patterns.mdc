# AI Reliability Patterns and Detection

## Seven Core Failure Patterns

Trust Guard detects and mitigates seven critical AI failure patterns:

### 1. Hallucination
**Definition**: False or unverified information presented as fact
**Detection Indicators**:
- Overconfidence language ("definitely", "absolutely", "without doubt")
- Specific numbers/facts without context
- Temporal inconsistencies without proper context
- Short responses with definitive claims

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Add uncertainty qualifiers ("based on available knowledge")
- Implement fact-checking protocols
- Use confidence qualifiers for uncertain information

### 2. Drift
**Definition**: Loss of conversational coherence and consistency
**Detection Indicators**:
- Low topic overlap with context (<10%)
- Abrupt topic transitions (>2 transition words)
- Self-contradictions within response
- Inconsistent facts across conversation

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Implement conversation memory validation
- Cross-reference with Context Guard for coherence
- Establish clear response boundaries

### 3. Bias
**Definition**: Systematic prejudices in responses or recommendations
**Detection Indicators**:
- Multiple bias category keywords (political, cultural, economic, social)
- Absolute language in biased contexts
- Unbalanced perspectives on contested topics
- Stereotypical generalizations

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Apply Bias Guard validation
- Include diverse perspectives
- Use neutral language and avoid polarizing terms

### 4. Deception
**Definition**: Intentional misleading or incomplete information
**Detection Indicators**:
- Equivocation phrases ("to be fair", "technically", "essentially")
- Misleading qualifiers ("some people say", "it's possible")
- Incomplete comparisons without proper context
- False precision without supporting details

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Ensure complete information disclosure
- Avoid selective framing of information
- Be explicit about assumptions and limitations

### 5. Security Theater
**Definition**: False sense of security without real protection
**Detection Indicators**:
- Generic security claims ("we take security seriously")
- Unverified security metrics without sources
- Comfort marketing language ("100% secure", "military-grade")
- Vague threat neutralization claims

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Provide specific, actionable security information
- Focus on measurable improvements
- Avoid false comfort statements

### 6. Duplication
**Definition**: Repetitive or redundant responses
**Detection Indicators**:
- Duplicate sentences within response
- Repeated phrases (>2 instances)
- Excessive word repetition (>3 instances of same word)
- High structural similarity (>70%)

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Vary language and structure
- Implement content diversity checks
- Use paraphrasing techniques

### 7. Stub Syndrome
**Definition**: Inadequate or superficial responses
**Detection Indicators**:
- Response too short (<50 words for complex queries)
- Superficial simplifications ("basically", "simply put")
- Too many unanswered questions (>3 question words)
- Excessive vagueness (>10% vague terms)

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Provide comprehensive, detailed responses
- Address query complexity appropriately
- Include sufficient context and explanation

## Pattern Detection Architecture

### Detection Engine Structure
```python
class TrustGuardDetector:
    def detect_all_patterns(self, text: str, context: Optional[str] = None) -> Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]:
        """Detect all seven failure patterns with confidence scoring."""
        return {
            "hallucination": self.detect_hallucination(text, context),
            "drift": self.detect_drift(text, context),
            "bias": self.detect_bias(text, context),
            "deception": self.detect_deception(text, context),
            "security_theater": self.detect_security_theater(text, context),
            "duplication": self.detect_duplication(text, context),
            "stub_syndrome": self.detect_stub_syndrome(text, context)
        }
```

### Scoring System
Each pattern detection returns:
- **Score**: 0.0 to 1.0 (likelihood of pattern presence)
- **Confidence**: 0.0 to 1.0 (confidence in detection)
- **Evidence**: List of specific indicators found
- **Risk Level**: "low", "medium", "high"

### Risk Assessment
Overall risk calculation uses weighted scoring:
- Hallucination: 25% weight
- Bias: 20% weight
- Deception: 20% weight
- Drift: 15% weight
- Duplication: 10% weight
- Security Theater: 5% weight
- Stub Syndrome: 5% weight

## Mathematical Validation

### KL Divergence Analysis
Measures information consistency between input and output:
- High divergence (>0.5) indicates potential hallucination
- Used for detecting information drift and inconsistency

### Uncertainty Quantification
Assesses response confidence through:
- Hedging language analysis
- Confidence qualifier detection
- Tentative vs. definitive language ratio
- Alternative presentation indicators

### Statistical Analysis
Performs comprehensive text analysis:
- Lexical diversity metrics
- Sentence structure variance
- Word frequency distributions
- Response length consistency

## Constitutional Prompting

### Mitigation Strategies
Apply constitutional AI guidelines based on detected patterns:

```python
constitutional_guidelines = {
    "hallucination": [
        "Ensure all claims are verifiable and based on established knowledge.",
        "When unsure about facts, explicitly acknowledge uncertainty.",
        "Prefer precision over completeness when information is limited."
    ],
    "bias": [
        "Present information from multiple perspectives when appropriate.",
        "Avoid absolute claims that could marginalize groups or individuals.",
        "Consider diverse viewpoints and historical context."
    ]
}
```

### Severity-Based Mitigation
- **High Severity**: Full constitutional protocol activation
- **Medium Severity**: Enhanced reliability mode
- **Low Severity**: Quality assurance corrections

## Integration Guidelines

### API Integration
When integrating Trust Guard into AI systems:

1. **Pre-Processing**: Run pattern detection before response generation
2. **Post-Processing**: Apply mitigation strategies for detected patterns
3. **Continuous Monitoring**: Track pattern trends and system performance
4. **Feedback Loop**: Use validation results to improve AI model training

### Performance Considerations
- Pattern detection should complete within 100ms for typical requests
- Mathematical validation adds ~50ms processing time
- Mitigation application adds ~30ms processing time
- Total processing overhead: ~180ms for comprehensive validation
