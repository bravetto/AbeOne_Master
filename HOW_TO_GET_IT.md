## 🎯 Quick Start - Two Ways to Get It!

### Option 1: Flutter App (Easiest - Interactive!)

```bash
# 1. Go to the app directory
cd abeone_app

# 2. Run it!
flutter run -d chrome
```

**That's it!** The app will open in Chrome. Then:
- The app starts at the Materialization screen
- **Navigate to `/thanksgiving`** in your browser URL bar
- OR update `main.dart` to set Thanksgiving as home (see below)

---

### Option 2: Generate Video File

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies (one time only)
pip3 install pillow moviepy

# 2. Generate the video
python3 scripts/generate_thanksgiving_video.py

# 3. Find your video!
# Location: abeone_app/assets/videos/thanksgiving_video.mp4
```

## 🎨 Make Thanksgiving the Home Screen

Want Thanksgiving to show first? Update `main.dart`:

```dart
// Change this line:
home: const MaterializationScreen(),

// To this:
home: const ThanksgivingVideoScreen(),
```

Then run:
```bash
cd abeone_app
flutter run -d chrome
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Flutter Not Found?
```bash
# Check if Flutter is installed
flutter --version

# If not, install Flutter:
# https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
```

### Python Dependencies Missing?
```bash
# Install required packages
pip3 install pillow moviepy
```

### Video Generation Fails?
- The script will still generate frames even without moviepy
- Frames will be in: `abeone_app/assets/videos/frames/`
- Install moviepy to compile frames into video: `pip3 install moviepy`

### Can't See Thanksgiving Screen?
- Make sure you navigate to `/thanksgiving` route
- OR change `home:` in `main.dart` to `ThanksgivingVideoScreen()`
