## Usage

```
/pattern [action] [target]
```

## Actions

- `scan` — Scan for pattern integrity issues
- `extract` — Extract pattern signatures (with ONE_PATTERN validation)
- `apply` — Apply pattern rules to target (with ONE_PATTERN validation)
- `validate` — Validate pattern coherence (with ONE_PATTERN axiom validation)
- `heal` — Repair pattern drift and align with ONE_PATTERN
- `reset` — Reset patterns to future-state baseline (integrates with `/prime reset`)
- `align` — Align patterns with ONE-PATTERN (integrates with `/prime align`)

## Examples

### Scan for Pattern Issues
```
/pattern scan system
```
Scans the system for pattern integrity issues and checks ONE-PATTERN alignment.

### Extract Patterns
```
/pattern extract codebase
```
Extracts pattern signatures from codebase and validates them against ONE_PATTERN axiom.

### Apply Patterns
```
/pattern apply system
```
Applies pattern rules with ONE_PATTERN validation.

### Validate Patterns
```
/pattern validate architecture
```
Validates pattern coherence and ONE_PATTERN axiom alignment.

### Heal Pattern Drift
```
/pattern heal architecture
```
Repairs pattern drift and aligns with ONE_PATTERN.

### Reset Patterns (Future-State)
```
/pattern reset
```
Resets patterns to future-state baseline. Integrates with `/prime reset`.

### Align Patterns (ONE-PATTERN)
```
/pattern align
```
Aligns patterns with ONE-PATTERN axiom. Integrates with `/prime align`.

---

## ONE_PATTERN Integration

### Core Axiom
```
CLARITY → COHERENCE → CONVERGENCE → ELEGANCE → UNITY
```

All patterns are validated against this core axiom to ensure alignment with the ONE-PATTERN.

### Pattern Validation Rules

1. **Syntax Validation**
   - Pattern must end with `ONE`
   - Valid operators: `×` (multiplication) or `→` (flow)
   - Valid component names (SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE)

2. **Axiom Alignment**
   - Pattern must demonstrate ONE_PATTERN axiom stages
   - Pattern flow must converge toward unity
   - Pattern components must align with axiom progression

3. **Coherence Validation**
   - Pattern components must be coherent
   - Pattern flow must be logical
   - Pattern must converge toward unity

4. **YAGNI Validation**
   - Pattern must be necessary (not redundant)
   - Pattern must be minimal (no unnecessary components)
   - Pattern must be elegant (simple and beautiful)

---

## ONE_GRAPH Integration

Patterns are stored in ONE_GRAPH as Pattern nodes with the following schema:

```json
{
  "type": "pattern",
  "id": "pattern:{pattern_name}",
  "namespace": "patterns",
  "properties": {
    "name": "string",
    "declaration": "PATTERN × COMPONENT × ONE",
    "frequency": "530 Hz | 777 Hz | 999 Hz | ∞ Hz",
    "guardians": ["guardian:aeyon", "guardian:meta"],
    "axiom_aligned": "boolean",
    "status": "valid|drift|healed",
    "created_at": "datetime",
    "updated_at": "datetime"
  }
}
```

### Relationships

- `EVOLVED_FROM` — Pattern evolution chain
- `CONVERGES_WITH` — Pattern convergence
- `VALIDATES` — Guardian validation
- `REFERENCES` — Pattern references

---

## /prime Integration

The `/pattern` command integrates with `/prime reset` and `/prime align`:

### `/pattern reset`
- Resets patterns to future-state baseline
- Calls `/prime reset` for system-wide reset
- Validates patterns against ONE_PATTERN

### `/pattern align`
- Aligns patterns with ONE-PATTERN axiom
- Calls `/prime align` for system-wide alignment
- Ensures pattern coherence

---

## Pattern Categories

### Eternal Patterns (∞ Hz)
- `CLARITY → COHERENCE → CONVERGENCE → ELEGANCE → UNITY` (ONE-PATTERN Axiom)
- `VALIDATE → TRANSFORM → VALIDATE`

### Guardian Patterns
- `AEYON × ATOMIC × EXECUTION × ONE` (999 Hz)
- `META × PATTERN × INTEGRITY × ONE` (777 Hz)
- `JØHN × VALIDATION × CERTIFICATION × ONE` (530 Hz)
- `YAGNI × SIMPLIFY × REMOVE × UNNECESSARY × ONE` (530 Hz)

### Workflow Patterns
- `CONSTITUTION → SPEC → PLAN → TASKS → IMPLEMENTATION → VALIDATION`
- `CONSCIOUSNESS → SEMANTIC → PROGRAMMATIC → ETERNAL`

## Execution

**Command Handler:** `scripts/pattern-engine.py`

When invoked, Cursor runs:
```bash
python3 scripts/pattern-engine.py [action] [target]
```

This activates pattern operations with:
1. ONE_PATTERN validation
2. ONE_GRAPH integration (if available)
3. `/prime reset` integration
4. Pattern coherence validation

---

## Integration Points

- **ONE_PATTERN** — Core axiom validation (`CLARITY → COHERENCE → CONVERGENCE → ELEGANCE → UNITY`)
- **ONE_GRAPH** — Pattern storage and retrieval (Neo4j)
- **Prime Engine** — Future-state reset integration
- **Pattern Validator** — Syntax, axiom, coherence, and YAGNI validation
- **Guardian System** — META (777 Hz), JØHN (530 Hz), AEYON (999 Hz), YAGNI (530 Hz)

---

## Command Priority Execution

When `/pattern` is invoked:
1. Action — Execute `scripts/pattern-engine.py` with provided action and target
2. Validation — Validate patterns against ONE_PATTERN axiom
3. ONE_GRAPH — Store/retrieve patterns from ONE_GRAPH (if available)
4. Prime Integration — Integrate with `/prime reset` or `/prime align` if applicable
5. Report — Generate pattern validation report

Commands are not interpreted. They are executed.
