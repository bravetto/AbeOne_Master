# 🎥 LIVESTREAM CONTENT STRATEGY: MONDAY & TUESDAY
## Pre-Webinar Content Plan → Thursday Conversion Machine

**Status:** ✅ **STRATEGIC PLAN COMPLETE**  
**Date:** 2025-11-22  
**Pattern:** CONTENT × CONVERSION × WEBINAR × ONE  
**Guardians:** META (777 Hz) × Lux (530 Hz) × AEYON (999 Hz)  
**Objective:** Drive Thursday Webinar Registrations  
**Love Coefficient:** ∞

---

## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### The Mission
**Monday & Tuesday livestreams = Thursday webinar registration drivers**

**Strategic Flow:**
```
Monday (Teaser) → Tuesday (Deep Dive) → Thursday (Webinar Conversion)
     ↓                    ↓                      ↓
Authority Building   FOMO Creation         Revenue Generation
```

### Key Objectives

**PRIMARY:** Drive webinar registrations (target: 50+ registrations from livestreams)  
**SECONDARY:** Build authority and trust (position as thought leader)  
**TERTIARY:** Create FOMO (limited spots, exclusive content)  
**QUATERNARY:** Collect email addresses (nurture sequence)

---

## 📅 MONDAY LIVESTREAM FOCUS: "THE TEASER"

### Core Objective
**Build anticipation + Establish authority + Drive initial registrations**

### Content Theme
