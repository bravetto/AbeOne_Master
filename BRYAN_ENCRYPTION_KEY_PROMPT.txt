I need to receive and set up the encryption keys for the AbëKEYs system to access marketing automation credentials (SendGrid, Google Ads, Stripe).

**CONTEXT:**
- The encrypted vault `abekeys_vault.encrypted.json` is already in the repository
- I need to receive the encryption key from the team lead to decrypt it
- Once decrypted, I can access credentials via: `python3 scripts/abekeys/abekeys_encrypted.py get sendgrid`

**WHAT I NEED FROM TEAM LEAD:**
The encryption key file (`vault_key.key` or if they're using a different system: `hmac_key.key` and `kdf_salt.key`)

**SETUP STEPS:**

1. **Receive the encryption key securely** (from team lead via SSH, Age encryption, or password-protected zip)

2. **Save the key to the correct location:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.abekeys
   cp received_key.key ~/.abekeys/vault_key.key
   chmod 600 ~/.abekeys/vault_key.key
   ```

3. **Verify the encrypted vault exists:**
   ```bash
   ls -la abekeys_vault.encrypted.json
   ```

4. **Test decryption:**
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/abekeys/abekeys_encrypted.py get sendgrid
   python3 scripts/abekeys/abekeys_encrypted.py get google_ads
   python3 scripts/abekeys/abekeys_encrypted.py get stripe
   ```

**ALTERNATIVE: Use automated script:**
```bash
./scripts/abekeys/receive_key_secure.sh
```

**IF TEAM LEAD USES DIFFERENT FORMAT:**
- If they send `hmac_key.key` and `kdf_salt.key` instead of `vault_key.key`, help me understand which encryption method they're using and how to set it up correctly.

Please guide me through receiving the encryption key securely, saving it correctly, and verifying I can decrypt and access all three credentials (sendgrid, google_ads, stripe).
