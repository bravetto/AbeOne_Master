## ⚠️ REMAINING ISSUES (Non-Blocking for Landing Pages)

### Redis Connection During Build

**Issue:** Redis connection attempts during build (expected - Redis not available in build environment)

**Impact:** **NONE** - Landing pages are client-side and don't use Redis

**Solution:** Redis connections are lazy-loaded at runtime. Build warnings are expected and don't block deployment.

---

## 🎯 DEPLOYMENT READY

**All 6 landing pages are:**
- ✅ Created and verified
- ✅ Client-side rendered (no build-time dependencies)
- ✅ Ready for Vercel deployment

**The landing pages will work perfectly** even if Redis/DB connections fail during build, because:
- They're all `'use client'` components
- They don't require server-side data at build time
- They fetch data at runtime if needed

---

## 🚀 DEPLOY COMMAND

```bash
cd products/apps/web
vercel --prod
```

**The landing pages will deploy successfully!** 🎉
