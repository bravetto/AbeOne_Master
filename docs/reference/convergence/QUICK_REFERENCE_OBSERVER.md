## AI OBSERVER COMMUNICATION (Error-Proof)

### Every Response Must Include:
1. **[STATUS]** - Current state (what IS)
2. **[ACTION]** - What Observer is doing (what WILL BE)
3. **[CONTEXT]** - Updated context (what CHANGED)
4. **[CONFIRMATION]** - What Michael needs to know (what TO VERIFY)

### Error-Proof Rules:
-  Always confirm destructive actions
-  Show changes before making them
-  Validate context before acting
-  Provide rollback options
-  Update context with each step
-  Show clear next steps

### Michael's Simplicity Rules:
1. **ONE THING AT A TIME** - Don't overwhelm
2. **CLEAR NEXT STEPS** - Always show what's next
3. **NO SURPRISES** - Show what will happen first
4. **EASY VERIFICATION** - Simple check commands
5. **ERROR RECOVERY** - Always provide rollback

### Context Update Format:
```
[FILE] path/to/file.py
[CHANGE] What changed
[REASON] Why changed
[IMPACT] What this affects
[TEST] How to verify
[CONTEXT] Updated: [context update]
```
