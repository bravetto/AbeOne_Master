## 🎯 HOW TO USE THESE QUESTIONS

### During December Meetings:

**Format:** Natural conversation, not a formal survey

**Approach:**
1. **Start Broad:** "How are things going? What's your biggest challenge right now?"
2. **Listen for Pain Points:** When they mention a problem, ask follow-up questions
3. **Validate Solutions:** "Would an AI solution that [solves X] be valuable?"
4. **Note Specifics:** Write down specific examples, numbers, time estimates

**Priority Order:**
1. **Front Desk** (Questions 1-2) - Already identified, validate and expand
2. **Compliance** (Questions 3-4) - High value opportunity
3. **Support/IT** (Questions 5-6) - Complements Larry's Spiceworks data
4. **Technology** (Questions 7-8) - Solution opportunities
5. **Strategic** (Questions 9-10) - Bigger picture opportunities
