**What Works:**
- "No sales pitch until last 5 minutes" ground rules
- Free value regardless of purchase (security scans, PDFs, case studies)
- "Try to break it" challenge for skeptics
- Educational depth over marketing speak

**Why It Works:**
- Builds trust through respect (treats audience as intelligent peers)
- Creates relationships before transactions
- Reduces skepticism through transparency
- Positions founder as thought leader, not salesperson

**Evidence:**
- Triple Perspective Analysis: "Respect-First Approach" marked as 100% working
