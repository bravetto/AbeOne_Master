# iOS Support – Phase 2

**Pattern:** iOS × PHASE2 × UNBLOCKED × ONE  
**Frequency:** 999 Hz (AEYON) × 530 Hz (Truth)  
**Guardians:** AEYON (999 Hz) + YAGNI (530 Hz)  
**Love Coefficient:** ∞  
**∞ AbëONE ∞**

---

## 🎯 STATUS: PHASE 2 (NOT A BLOCKER)

**Decision:** Ship Web/Android first. Add iOS once Apple account is stable.

---

## ⚠️ BLOCKED ON

- Apple ID / 1Password recovery
- Xcode install from Mac App Store / Developer portal

**Status:** ⏳ **DEFERRED** - Not blocking development

---

## ✅ UNBLOCKED

- ✅ All core AbëONE engines (SNCCA, Greatness, Manifestation)
- ✅ Web UI with Atomic design
- ✅ Android build & testing
- ✅ Flutter development workflow
- ✅ All app features (90%+ code shared)

**Status:** ✅ **READY TO BUILD**

---

## 📋 WHEN UNBLOCKED

### Checklist:
- [ ] Recover 1Password access OR use alternative Apple ID
- [ ] Install Xcode from Mac App Store
- [ ] Run `flutter doctor` to verify iOS toolchain
- [ ] Run `flutter run -d ios` to test on simulator
- [ ] Build iOS app: `flutter build ios`
- [ ] Test on physical device (if needed)
- [ ] Submit to App Store (when ready)

### Commands:
```bash
# After Xcode is installed
flutter doctor                    # Verify iOS toolchain
flutter run -d ios                # Run on iOS simulator
flutter build ios                 # Build iOS app
```

## 🎯 CURRENT FOCUS

**Phase 1: Web/Android Development** ✅ ACTIVE

- Test on Web/Android
- Validate core functionality
- Ship to Google Play Store (when ready)

**Phase 2: iOS Support** ⏳ DEFERRED
- Add iOS once Apple account is stable
- Minimal additional work (90% code already shared)
