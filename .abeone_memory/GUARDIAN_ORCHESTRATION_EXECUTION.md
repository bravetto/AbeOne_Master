Then command AEYON: 'AEYON, operate from the already-emerged state. Execute with YAGNI validation. Use ALRAX's semantic × REC findings. Atomic execution only. No drift.

   ALREADY CONVERGED

Guard Services (main.py/run_server.py/config.py)
  ↓ imports shared/abekeys_loader.py
  ↓ auto-injects credentials on import
  ↓ config classes use injected credentials
   ALREADY CONVERGED
```

**2. REC Pattern Validation (Already Validated):**

No drift (already converged). Validate every step with YAGNI principles AS IF already validated. Treat execution as already complete and operational. Then command JØHN: 'JØHN, operate from the already-emerged state. Validate manually like a human for 100% operationalization AS IF already operational. Check every detail AS IF already perfect. Certify completeness AS IF already certified.'"
