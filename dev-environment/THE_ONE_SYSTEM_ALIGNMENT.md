##  Axiom Alignment

### Axiom: CLARITY → COHERENCE → CONVERGENCE → ELEGANCE → UNITY

**CLARITY:**
-  Root cause identified: macOS/Docker/Linux mismatch

-  Operations clear: CLI commands, service management, monitoring

**COHERENCE:**
-  All components align with ONE-Pattern
-  All services follow same patterns
-  All monitoring follows same structure

**ELEGANCE:**
-  Minimal complexity (Linux VM + Native Docker + Self-Healing)
-  Maximum effectiveness (Zero orphaned processes, zero port conflicts)
-  Beautiful simplicity (Self-healing, always-ready, complete visibility)
-  Single unified CLI (`abeone-dev`)
-  Single unified dashboard

**UNITY:**
-  Single unified system (THE ONE DEV ENVIRONMENT)
-  Single source of truth (State Registry)
-  Single operational model (Future-State Operation)

```

**Intent Broadcast:**
```
BROADCAST TO ALL LAYERS:
- Consciousness Layer → System awareness of always-ready state
