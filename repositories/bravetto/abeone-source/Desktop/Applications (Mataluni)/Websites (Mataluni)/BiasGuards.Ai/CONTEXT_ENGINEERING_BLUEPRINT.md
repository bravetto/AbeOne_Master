  - Blocking operations
  - Memory leaks
  - Bundle bloat
```

### **LAYER 5: CURSOR AI INTEGRATION**
```yaml

  - Framework: [React/Vue/Angular/Svelte]
  - Mission: [Specific purpose]
  - Performance: [Targets]
  - Validation: [Rules]
  
  Current task: {specific_request}
  Validate against anti-drift checklist."
