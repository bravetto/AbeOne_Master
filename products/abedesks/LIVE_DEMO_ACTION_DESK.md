## 💎 ONE-LINERS FOR EACH TEAM MEMBER

### Danny (Infrastructure)
**"I built the AWS infrastructure that runs all guard services in production - EKS clusters, Linkerd service mesh, ECR registry, Terraform CI/CD."**

### Ben (Backend)
**"I built the scalable FastAPI backend that orchestrates 149 agents and provides unified API gateway for all guard services."**

### Jimmy (Intelligence)
**"I built the neuromorphic AI engine that processes code using biologically-inspired neural networks - beyond basic transformers."**

### PHANI (Monitoring)
**"I built the unified health monitoring system that tracks all services, resources, and dependencies in real-time."**

---

## 🔥 QUICK STATS TO MENTION

- **277+ tests** (100% coverage)
- **Production-ready codebase** context
- **149-agent swarm** system
- **6 guard services** in production
- **8 guardians** operational
- **100% production ready**
