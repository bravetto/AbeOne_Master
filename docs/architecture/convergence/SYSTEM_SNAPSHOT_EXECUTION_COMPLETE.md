##  USAGE

### Execute Snapshot

```python
from EMERGENT_OS.triadic_execution_harness.system_snapshot import execute_full_system_snapshot

# Execute snapshot
snapshot = execute_full_system_snapshot()

# Or specify custom path
snapshot = execute_full_system_snapshot(output_path="/path/to/snapshot.json")
```

### Access Snapshot

```python
import json

# Read snapshot
with open("EMERGENT_OS/state/system_snapshot.json", 'r') as f:
    snapshot = json.load(f)

# Access components
guardian_swarm = snapshot["guardian_swarm_states"]
triadic_unity = snapshot["triadic_unity_state"]
johhn_chain = snapshot["johhn_e2e_certification_chain"]
validation = snapshot["validation_results"]
signature = snapshot["johhn_signature"]
```
