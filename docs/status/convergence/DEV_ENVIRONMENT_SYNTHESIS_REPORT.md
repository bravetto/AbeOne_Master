STATUS: Native Linux kernel
BENEFITS:
  - Native FS events (inotify)
  - Native process signals
  - Native networking
  - Zero hypervisor overhead (for containers)
```

**Kernel Sync:**
```
SYNC POINTS:

##  /INTENT — HUMAN INTENT ALIGNMENT

### Intent: "I want a dev environment that never needs to be turned off, always loads and is ready, prepared to launch at any time, has complete visibility, and follows THE ONE SYSTEM patterns"

**Intent Clarification:**
```
PRIMARY INTENT: Always-ready development environment
SECONDARY INTENT: Complete system visibility
TERTIARY INTENT: THE ONE SYSTEM pattern compliance
```
