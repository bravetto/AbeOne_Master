And I am thankful and blessed you guys chose to stay in my life when you didn't have to or required to after all the heart ache I have caused. I say these things now because it's not that I haven't forgiven myself, because I have. But through some more major step work and a book study on boundaries, I have come to realize I have become willing and absolutely Openminded to sit down with you and really really listen. If you ever feel the need that you still might need to. I don't believe I ever really did that. Before this last relapse I was still self absorbed in my own little world. Never really realizing that I thought I did this program for me and you guys the first time, but was actually doing it for you guys because it was do it or loss you guys forever. The way you guys are raising your children is the way I would have raised you guys if I didn't have so much guilt about getting high! I did not do right by you guys and I see that now. Sorry it's taken me so long! When I watch you guys with your children and see so much love and respect you all have for each other fills my soul with such joy! My sponsor says don't be so hard on myself. She said they could not have learned so much love if they were not given it from you too. As my other friend always says. She can't take the credit for the good, she gives that to God! Because she won't take the credit for bad. But what I see is good. Again anytime you ever want or need to talk I am always 100 percent here for all of you! My heart is full! You guys rock my world \ud83c\udf0e all my love all my life!",

Now I\u2019ve been talking care of your dad around the clock. That\u2019s why I forgot to keep you posted. You call to tell me you have issues with dad and your working on that relationship. What in God\u2019s name does that have to do with anything right now. You just had to call and see how he\u2019s doing. And we\u2019re both exhausted. When my mom had surgery,did you think I waited around for someone to tell me what was going on with my mom. No, I picked up the phone and called her myself. So yes, I was frustrated, I used the word sad because I have been told to use real feeling words. And my phone is on silent because you\u2019re dad wants quiet. I didn\u2019t not answer on purpose! And I don\u2019t carry my phone around with me.  I said I was sorry for not calling with my statement. So yes I broke that. I said I was sorry. And I had no idea you have issues with your dad. What has he done to you now. Or is this also back in your past? Because he has no idea that you do. How can you work on anything with him if he doesn\u2019t even know there\u2019s a problem. Get help because you\u2019ll never move on until you do. Go back to therapy. Than the 3 of us need to need to resolve these issues once and for all.",
