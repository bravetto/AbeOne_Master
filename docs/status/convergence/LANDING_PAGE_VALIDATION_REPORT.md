##  CRITICAL DISCREPANCY ANALYSIS

### **The Confusion**:

**User Query**: "We are currently offering 8 Guardians on the page"

**Reality Check**:
1.  Landing page copy (`LANDING_PAGE_COPY_FINAL.md`) offers **4 Guards** (correct)
2.  Backend has **5-6 Guards** available (more than offered)
3.  Backend has **8 Guardians** (but these are infrastructure, not product)

**Possible Scenarios**:
- **Scenario A**: Landing page was updated to offer 8 Guardians, but copy doc not updated
- **Scenario B**: User refers to "8 Guardians" but means the 8 Guardian microservices
- **Scenario C**: Marketing confusion between Guards (product) and Guardians (infrastructure)

**Action Required**:
1.  Check actual landing page (currently requires auth)
2.  Compare with `LANDING_PAGE_COPY_FINAL.md`
3.  Identify if there's a mismatch

**Recommendation**: 
- If landing page says "8 Guardians", clarify:
  - 4-5 Guards = The Product (what customers buy)
