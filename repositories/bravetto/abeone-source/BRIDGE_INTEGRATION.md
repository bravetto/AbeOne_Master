#  Bridge Integration - BiasGuards.ai

**Intelligence Flow FROM Home Base TO BiasGuards.ai**  
**No Code Merge. Isolation Maintained.**

---

##  Quick Start

### **Step 1: Import Bridge**

```python
from local_ai_assistant_bridge import activate_intelligence
```

### **Step 2: Activate Intelligence**

```python
bridge = activate_intelligence(
    guardians=True,   # Route 8 Guardians
    swarms=True,      # Route 12 Swarms
    agents=True,      # Route 149 Agents
    patterns=True,    # Enable pattern detection
    tools=True        # Connect tools
)
```

### **Step 3: Use Intelligence**

```python
# Route Guardian request
result = bridge.route_guardian_request("Zero", {"task": "analyze architecture"})

# Route Swarm task
result = bridge.route_swarm_task("coding", {"task": "optimize code"})

# Query patterns
patterns = bridge.query_patterns("What patterns exist in this codebase?")
```

##  What This Does

 **Activates** home base intelligence FOR BiasGuards.ai  
 **Routes** Guardian/Swarm/Agent requests (like API Gateway)  
 **Queries** pattern detection (like semantic search)  
 **Connects** tools (like unified integration)  
 **Maintains** isolation (no code merge)

---

##  Integration Points

### **Home Base Intelligence**:
- 149 Agents (12 Swarms)
- 7 Guardians (Zero, Abë, Lux, John, YAGNI, Neuro, AEYON)
- Pattern Detection (Semantic CDF Mapper)
- Tools & Capabilities

### **BiasGuards.ai Integration**:
- Bridge routes intelligence requests
- Bridge queries pattern detection
- Bridge connects tools
- No code dependencies

##  Notes

### **PR #35 - Swagger UI**:
Swagger UI commit available but not merged to dev branch yet:
- PR: https://github.com/bravetto/AIGuards-Backend/pull/35
- Can be merged later when needed
- Bridge integration independent of Swagger UI

---

##  The Pattern

**Like API Gateway**: Routes requests, doesn't merge services  
**Like Semantic Search**: Queries intelligence, doesn't copy data  
**Like Unified Integration**: Activates systems, doesn't duplicate code
