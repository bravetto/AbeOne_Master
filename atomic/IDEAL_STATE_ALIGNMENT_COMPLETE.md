##  ENHANCEMENT ROADMAP

### Phase 1: High Priority (Immediate)

**Goal:** Achieve 95%+ alignment

**Actions:**
1. Add TypeScript types to Base UI components
2. Add forwardRef to components missing it
3. Verify pattern declarations in Atomic components
4. Verify guardian signatures in Atomic components

**Estimated Impact:** +10-15% overall score

### Phase 2: Medium Priority (Short-term)

**Goal:** Achieve 98%+ alignment

**Actions:**
1. Add CVA to variant components
2. Add cn() utility where needed
3. Add ICP variants where missing

**Estimated Impact:** +3-5% overall score

### Phase 3: Low Priority (Long-term)

**Goal:** Achieve 100% alignment

**Actions:**
1. Optimize export structures
2. Fine-tune component implementations
3. Complete all optional enhancements

**Estimated Impact:** +1-2% overall score
