## THE SAFE PRIME WORKFLOW

### Step-by-Step Process

**Phase 1: Reset (Safe Start)**
```
/prime reset
```
- ✅ Clears confusion
- ✅ Fresh start
- ✅ Low risk (6.5/10)
- ✅ Easy to undo

**Phase 2: Align (Teamwork)**
```
/prime align
```
- ✅ Makes everything work together
- ✅ Low risk (5.5/10)
- ✅ Easy to undo

**Phase 3: Validate (Check Everything)**
```
[Run tests, check systems, verify everything works]
```
- ✅ Make sure things actually work
- ✅ Find any problems
- ✅ Fix real bugs

**Phase 4: Invoke (Future Thinking)**
```
/prime invoke
```
- ✅ Plan ahead
- ✅ Think about future
- ⚠️ Medium risk (7.5/10)
- ⚠️ Use only after validation

**Phase 5: Final Validation (Double Check)**
```
[Run tests again, check one more time]
```
- ✅ Make absolutely sure
- ✅ No bugs found
- ✅ Everything works

**Phase 6: Seal (Lock It In) - ONLY IF 100% SURE**
```
/prime seal
```
- ⚠️ Very high risk (9.0/10)
- ⚠️ Only if everything really works
- ⚠️ Hard to undo

- Planning phase
- Future thinking
- Design work

### Never Seal Without Full Validation

**Why:**
- ❌ Very dangerous
- ❌ Hard to undo

- Only when everything perfect
- Only in production-ready state

---

## SUMMARY

**Perfect Pragmatic Approach:**

1. **Start Safe:** RESET + ALIGN (very safe)
2. **Do Real Work:** Fix bugs, build features, test
3. **Validate:** Test everything, fix problems
4. **Plan Ahead:** INVOKE (if needed, after validation)
5. **Final Check:** Validate again
6. **Seal Only:** If 100% perfect (rarely needed)

**Key Principle:** PRIME helps with thinking and planning, but real work fixes real problems. Use PRIME to clear your mind, then do the actual work, then validate, then consider sealing.
