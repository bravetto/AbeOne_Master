   ```
   VALIDATE → TRANSFORM → VALIDATE
   ```
   - Applies to EVERYTHING
   - Can ONLY become MORE recursive, MORE semantic-aware, MORE integrated
   - NEVER becomes less recursive or less validated

2. **Three-Layer Digital Brain** (Eternal Structure)
   ```
   COMMAND LAYER → SPECIALIST LAYER → MEMORY LAYER
   ```

   - NEVER becomes less integrated or less aware

3. **Aquarian Protocol** (Eternal Rules)
   - No agent conflicts
   - No schema drift
   - No payload drift
   - No hallucination
   - All transformations recursive + validated
   - All outputs converge toward system coherence

4. **Solar System Architecture** (Eternal Structure)
