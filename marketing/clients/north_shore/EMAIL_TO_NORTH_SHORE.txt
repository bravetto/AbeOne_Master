Subject: Follow-Up from Our Meeting - Next Steps

Hi Trish, Larry, and Ryan,

Thanks for taking the time to meet with us today. We're really excited about working together.

Here's what we found:

We discovered that your clients have some problems we can solve with AI. The biggest one is front desk staffing - finding people who stay. We have a solution called Wellness Agent.ai that can handle phone calls so you don't need front desk staff. This solves a real problem your clients have.

We also found opportunities around:
- Compliance work (making it easier)
- Support ticket patterns (finding problems before they happen)
- Other ways to help your clients grow

What we need from you:

Larry - Can you export your Spiceworks support tickets as a CSV file and send it to jimmy@bravetto.com? We'll analyze it and have insights back to you within 20 minutes. This will help us see what problems come up most often.

Trish - During your December meetings with clients, can you ask them about their biggest challenges? We've attached a simple list of questions you can use. Just have a natural conversation - no formal survey needed. Send us the notes and we'll turn them into solutions.

Why this matters:

The more we know about your clients' problems, the better solutions we can build. And the better solutions we build, the more value we can provide to your clients - which means more revenue for North Shore.

What happens next:

1. Larry sends the Spiceworks data → We analyze it → We find opportunities
2. Trish asks questions in December → Sends us notes → We build solutions
3. We present solutions → Your clients get value → Everyone wins

We've attached two PDFs with all the details:
- One for Larry (what data we need and how to send it)
- One for Trish (questions to ask and how to collect the information)

We're ready to move fast on this. The sooner we get the data, the sooner we can start building solutions that help your clients.

Thanks again for your time today. Looking forward to working together!

Best,
Michael & Bryan

P.S. - If you have any questions, just reach out. We're here to help make this easy.
