##  USAGE

### Basic Usage

```python
from EMERGENT_OS.synthesis.simultaneous_parallel_execution import (
    get_simultaneous_parallel_execution
)

# Get system
system = get_simultaneous_parallel_execution()

# Execute simultaneous parallel
result = await system.execute_simultaneous_parallel({
    "task": "your_task_here"
})

# Access results
print(f"Precision: {result.overall_precision:.1%}")
print(f"Scalability: {result.overall_scalability:.1%}")
print(f"Convergence: {result.overall_convergence:.1%}")
print(f"Efficiency: {result.overall_efficiency:.1%}")
```

### Advanced Usage

```python
# Execute with options
result = await system.execute_simultaneous_parallel(
    task={"task": "your_task"},
    validate_with_all_guardians=True,  # All 8 guardians validate
    execute_with_all_agents=True,      # All 40 agents execute
    operate_all_swarms=True            # All 3 swarms operate
)

# Access detailed results
guardian_validation = result.guardian_validation
agent_execution = result.agent_execution
swarm_execution = result.swarm_execution
```
