## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Brand Story

**Born from real stakes. BiasGuard exists to stop AI bias.**

BiasGuard was created in a moment when AI bias nearly derailed justice. While building a website for the legal defense of JAHmere Webb – a wrongfully accused man – AI coding assistants repeatedly suggested biased language and discriminatory framings. Those outputs weren't just technical errors; they had the potential to reinforce prejudice and jeopardize a man's freedom.

That moment revealed a stark truth: if AI bias could endanger justice in a courtroom, it could just as easily harm businesses, individuals, and entire communities. BiasGuard was born from that urgency – built to detect, prevent, and guard against bias in AI systems before it causes real harm.

### 1.2 Why Us

**BiasGuard isn't theory. It's necessity.**

We were born from a real-world crisis, not a lab experiment. When AI bias threatened to take away a man's freedom, we saw how urgently safeguards were needed - and we built them.

## 2. LOGO

### 2.1 Emblem Logo

**Our emblem is the shorthand for the AI Guardian brand.**

It combines strength, protection, and continuity, reflecting our role as a guardian against bias in AI. The form is inspired by interconnected loops, symbolizing. Its metallic finish and shield element reinforce authority and trust, while the initials inside provide clarity in small-scale applications.

This emblem is designed to be instantly recognizable and versatile across digital and print environments. Whether used as a standalone mark, a favicon, or alongside the type, it conveys the protective and human-centric mission of AI Guardian.

**Visual Description:**
- Triquetra-like symbol (three interconnected loops)
- Metallic blue gradient finish (darker blue edges → lighter blue center)
- Dark blue shield element at convergence point
- White "AiG" letters inside shield (sans-serif capitals)

### 2.2 Clear Space

**To protect the integrity of the AI Guardian logo, it must always be surrounded by clear space.**

This ensures that the emblem remains distinct and uncluttered in every application. The minimum clear space is defined by the height of the shield element within the logo. No other text, graphics, or design elements should appear within this area.

Maintaining consistent clear space preserves the strength, balance, and recognizability of the AI Guardian emblem across all platforms.

**Rule:** Minimum clear space = height of shield element

### 2.3 Lockup

**The lockup defines the relationship between the AI Guardian emblem and the wordmark.**

- **Emblem:** Proportioned at 10x height
- **BiasGuard name type:** Set at 4x height
- **Spacing:** Fixed at 1.5x between emblem and type

This structure preserves the strength of the emblem and the clarity/prominence of the name type. The lockup should always be reproduced according to these proportions and should not be altered, stretched, or repositioned.

**Components:**
- Emblem (10x height)
- "BiasGuard" wordmark (4x height, sans-serif, dark)
- "AI Guardian" tagline (smaller font, dark)
- Spacing: 1.5x between emblem and wordmark

### 2.4 Logo Color

**The AI Guardian logo is available in three approved color versions:**

1. **Primary (Metallic Finish)** - Preferred version
   - Represents full character and premium quality of the brand
   - Should be used whenever possible
   - Metallic blue gradient (darker → lighter blue)

2. **Black Version**
   - Suitable for lighter backgrounds
   - Simplified application when needed
   - Solid flat black

3. **White Version**
   - Use on dark or solid color backgrounds
   - Ensures legibility and brand consistency
   - Solid flat white

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** No other colors, treatments, or effects should be applied to the logo.

### 4.2 Type Size Relationship

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Typography Hierarchy:**
The AI Guardian type system follows a clear hierarchy to ensure readability and consistent structure across all communications. Body Copy, Subheaders, and Headers are scaled proportionally to maintain visual balance. Each step increases by approximately 50%, creating a natural rhythm between text levels.

This relationship ensures that headers capture attention, subheaders provide structure, and body text remains highly legible across digital and print formats. The scale also maintains consistency across different mediums, from presentations to product interfaces.

**Type Scale:**

| Level | Size (pt) | Size (px) | Size (rem) | Role | Usage |
|-------|-----------|-----------|------------|------|-------|
| **Body Copy** | 45pt | 60px | 3.75rem | Main body text | Body copy, paragraphs, general content |
| **Subheader** | 67.5pt | 90px | 5.625rem | Secondary headings | Subheaders, section titles, secondary headings |
| **Header** | 101.25pt | 135px | 8.4375rem | Primary headings | Headers, main titles, hero headlines |

**Scaling Rule:** Each step increases by approximately 50%
- Subheader = Body Copy × 1.5
- Header = Subheader × 1.5

**Font Weights:**
- Body Copy: Regular
- Subheader: Bold
- Header: Bold
