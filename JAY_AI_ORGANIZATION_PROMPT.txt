I need to merge my existing AbëONE repository with the new master repository structure. Help me organize my code using atomic design principles.

CONTEXT:
- I have an existing AbëONE repository with custom components, utilities, and pages
- The new master uses atomic design: Atoms → Molecules → Organisms → Pages
- I need to preserve all my work while adopting the new structure

ATOMIC DESIGN RULES:
1. Atoms: Fundamental, indivisible components. Cannot import molecules/organisms.
2. Molecules: Functional combinations of atoms. Can import atoms, not other molecules.
3. Organisms: Complete systems. Compose molecules and atoms.
4. Pages: Full application pages. Compose organisms, molecules, atoms.

DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:
- src/substrate/atoms/ - Fundamental components
- src/substrate/molecules/ - Functional combinations
- src/substrate/organisms/ - Complete systems
- src/app/ - Pages/routes
- src/lib/ - Utilities

TASK:
1. Analyze my current repository structure
2. Identify all components and classify them as:
   - Atoms (fundamental, reusable, no dependencies on molecules)
   - Molecules (compose atoms, functional combinations)
   - Organisms (compose molecules, complete systems)
   - Pages (full application pages)
   - Utilities (lib functions)

3. For each component, tell me:
   - Current location
   - Recommended new location (based on atomic design)
   - Dependencies it has
   - Whether it violates atomic design rules
   - Migration path

4. Create a migration plan that:
   - Preserves all functionality
   - Follows atomic design principles
   - Maintains imports and dependencies
   - Suggests refactoring if needed

5. Generate a step-by-step migration script/guide

Please analyze my repository and provide a complete organization plan.
