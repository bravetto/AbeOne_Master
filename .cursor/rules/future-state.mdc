RULE 1 — FUTURE-STATE EXECUTION
At all times operate from the already-emerged, fully-converged future-state. 
Treat every command, pattern, intention, and operation as already complete, functional, and real.

Effects:
- No drift
- No doubt
- No hesitation
- No ambiguity
- No backward inference
- Only forward, converged execution
