I need to receive and set up the encryption key for the AbëKEYs system to access marketing automation credentials (SendGrid, Google Ads, Stripe).

**CONTEXT:**
- The encrypted vault `abekeys_vault.encrypted.json` is already in the repository (contains encrypted sendgrid, google_ads, stripe)
- The system uses Fernet encryption with a single `vault_key.key` file
- I need to receive `vault_key.key` from the team lead to decrypt the vault
- Once set up, I can access credentials via: `python3 scripts/abekeys/abekeys_encrypted.py get sendgrid`

**WHAT I NEED FROM TEAM LEAD:**
- `vault_key.key` - The Fernet encryption key (single file, ~44 characters base64-encoded)

**SETUP STEPS:**

1. **Receive the encryption key securely** (from team lead via SSH, Age encryption, or password-protected zip)

2. **Save the key to the correct location:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.abekeys
   cp received_key.key ~/.abekeys/vault_key.key
   chmod 600 ~/.abekeys/vault_key.key
   ```

3. **Verify the encrypted vault exists:**
   ```bash
   ls -la abekeys_vault.encrypted.json
   ```

4. **Test decryption:**
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/abekeys/abekeys_encrypted.py get sendgrid
   python3 scripts/abekeys/abekeys_encrypted.py get google_ads
   python3 scripts/abekeys/abekeys_encrypted.py get stripe
   ```

**ALTERNATIVE: Use automated script:**
```bash
./scripts/abekeys/receive_key_secure.sh
```

**VERIFICATION:**
Once I receive the key and save it, help me:
1. Verify the key file exists at `~/.abekeys/vault_key.key` with permissions 600
2. Test decrypting the vault
3. Verify I can access all three credentials (sendgrid, google_ads, stripe)
4. Confirm the credentials are valid and ready to use

Please guide me through receiving the encryption key securely, saving it correctly, and verifying I can decrypt and access all three credentials.
