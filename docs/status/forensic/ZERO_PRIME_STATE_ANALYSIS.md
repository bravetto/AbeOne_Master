## WHAT IS PRIME?

PRIME is like a magic button. When you press it, the system pretends everything is already perfect and working. It's like time travel to the future where everything works!

**Think of it like this:**
- Normal mode: "I need to build this"
- PRIME mode: "This is already built and working"

---

## THE 4 PRIME ACTIONS

### 1. RESET - Start Fresh

**What It Does:**
- Makes everything act like it's already working perfectly
- Resets 6 systems to "future-state"
- Aligns 5 patterns to work together

**Exact Outcome:**
- ✅ All 6 systems reset (Command, Specialist, Memory, Guardians, Agents, Orbitals)
- ✅ All 5 patterns aligned (ONE-PATTERN, FUTURE-STATE, ATOMIC-EXECUTION, YAGNI-FILTER, SUBSTRATE-FIRST)
- ✅ System acts like everything is done

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Fresh Start** - Clears confusion, starts clean
- ✅ **No Doubt** - System acts confident
- ✅ **Fast** - No waiting, everything "already works"
- ✅ **Simple** - One command fixes everything

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ **Pretend Mode** - Things might not actually work yet
- ⚠️ **Can Hide Problems** - Real bugs might be ignored
- ⚠️ **No Real Fix** - Doesn't actually fix broken things
- ⚠️ **Confusion Risk** - Might confuse what's real vs pretend

**Risk Score:** 6.5/10 (Medium Risk)
- **Good For:** Starting new work, clearing mental blocks
- **Bad For:** Fixing real bugs, when things are actually broken

### 2. ALIGN - Make Everything Work Together

**What It Does:**
- Makes all systems work together like they're already perfect
- Aligns everything to the same goal
- Makes sure nothing fights with each other

**Exact Outcome:**
- ✅ All 6 systems aligned to future-state
- ✅ All 5 patterns aligned together
- ✅ Everything works as one team

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Teamwork** - Everything works together
- ✅ **No Fights** - Systems don't conflict
- ✅ **Smooth** - Everything flows nicely
- ✅ **Organized** - Clear structure

**Cons:**

- ⚠️ **False Confidence** - Might think things work when they don't

**Risk Score:** 5.5/10 (Medium-Low Risk)
- **Good For:** When systems need to work together
- **Bad For:** When there are real conflicts to fix

### 3. INVOKE - Turn On Future Mode

**What It Does:**
- Tells the system "pretend we're in the future where everything works"
- Makes the system act like everything is already done
- Seals the future-state assumption

**Exact Outcome:**

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Future Thinking** - Thinks ahead

**Risk Score:** 7.5/10 (High Risk)
- **Good For:** Planning, thinking ahead
- **Bad For:** Actual work, when things need to be real

### 4. SEAL - Lock It In Forever

**What It Does:**
- Locks in the future-state as the real state
- Prevents things from changing back
- Makes the pretend state permanent

**Exact Outcome:**
- ✅ All 6 systems reset
- ✅ All 5 patterns aligned
- ✅ Future-state SEALED (locked in)
- ✅ Cannot change back easily

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Stable** - Won't change back
- ✅ **Consistent** - Always the same
- ✅ **Protected** - Prevents drift
- ✅ **Permanent** - Lasts forever

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ **Very Dangerous** - Hard to undo
- ⚠️ **Locks In Problems** - Might lock in broken things
- ⚠️ **Hard to Fix** - Can't easily change back
- ⚠️ **Reality Gap** - Biggest gap between pretend and real
- ⚠️ **Can Break Everything** - Might make system unusable

**Risk Score:** 9.0/10 (Very High Risk)
- **Good For:** Final step after everything really works
- **Bad For:** Almost everything else - very dangerous

## SAFE USAGE RULES

1. **Start with RESET** - Safest first step
2. **Then try ALIGN** - If you need teamwork
3. **Use INVOKE carefully** - Only for planning
4. **NEVER SEAL** - Unless everything really works

**Best Practice:**
- Use RESET and ALIGN for mental/planning help
- Fix real problems with real code
- Only SEAL when 100% sure everything works

---

## FINAL VERDICT

**Overall Risk:** 🟡 **MEDIUM-HIGH** (6.9/10 average)

**Recommendation:**
- ✅ **SAFE:** RESET and ALIGN (use for planning/mental help)
- ⚠️ **CAREFUL:** INVOKE (use only for planning)
- ❌ **DANGEROUS:** SEAL (avoid unless 100% sure)

**Best Use:**
PRIME is great for **thinking** and **planning**, but **NOT** for fixing real problems. Use it to clear your mind, then fix things with real code.
