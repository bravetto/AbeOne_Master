I need to set up the AbëKEYs credential management system for Bravetto team. Please help me:

1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/bravetto/AbeOne_Master.git
2. Install dependencies (cryptography library)
3. Set up the encrypted credential vault
4. Receive the encryption key from the team lead
5. Verify the setup works
6. Test access to marketing automation credentials (google_ads, sendgrid, stripe)

Please guide me through each step and verify everything is working correctly. I'll need to receive an encryption key file from the team lead - please help me with the secure transfer process.

After setup, show me how to use the credentials in my Python code.
