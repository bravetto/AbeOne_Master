## 🎯 CONVERGENCE MANDATES

### MANDATE 1: Meta Orchestrator Integration

**Requirement:** ARDM must feed into Meta Orchestrator's META-SCAN phase

**Convergence Point:** Before operationalization, ARDM detects actionable items

**Flow:**
```
ARDM Detection → META-SCAN → VARIANCE ANALYSIS → CONVERGENCE → MANIFESTATION
```

**Implementation:**
- ARDM scans conversation context
- Detected items feed into Meta Orchestrator
- Meta Orchestrator operationalizes detected items
- Validation confirms completion

---

### MANDATE 2: Pre-Commit Hook Integration

**Requirement:** ARDM must check for undelivered actionable items before commits

**Convergence Point:** Pre-commit hook runs ARDM scan

**Flow:**
```
Pre-Commit → ARDM Scan → Check Undelivered Items → Block if Items Found
```

**Implementation:**
- Pre-commit hook calls ARDM
- ARDM scans staged changes and recent commits
- If undelivered items detected, warn or block commit
- Allow override with explicit flag

---

### MANDATE 3: Operationalization Workflow Integration

**Requirement:** ARDM must integrate with operationalization workflow

**Convergence Point:** Operationalization script includes ARDM check

**Flow:**
```
Operationalization → ARDM Scan → Detect Missing Items → Operationalize
```

**Implementation:**
- Operationalization script runs ARDM scan
- Detects any missing actionable items
- Operationalizes detected items
- Validates completion

---

### MANDATE 4: Validation Infrastructure Integration

**Requirement:** ARDM must integrate with existing validation patterns

**Convergence Point:** UnifiedValidatorBase integration

**Flow:**
```
Validation → ARDM Check → Report Actionable Items → Validate Delivery
```

**Implementation:**
- ARDM validator inherits from UnifiedValidatorBase
- Integrates with existing validation workflows
- Reports actionable items in validation reports
- Validates delivery of detected items

## ✅ CONVERGENCE PRINCIPLES

### 1. YAGNI Compliance
- Only integrate what is needed
- No speculative integrations
- Focus on explicit requirements

### 2. Substrate-First (John's Pattern)
- Verify substrate exists before integration
- Report missing substrate clearly
- Wait for explicit authorization

### 3. Atomic Integration
- Each integration is atomic and independent
- Can be enabled/disabled independently
- No circular dependencies

### 4. Validation at Every Step
- Validate integration points
- Verify convergence works
- Confirm operational status
