## 🔴 Critical Considerations
- **Technical:** WebSocket infrastructure needs scaling (estimated 2 weeks)
- **Dependencies:** Requires AbëFLOWs integration for user presence
- **Resources:** Need 2 frontend engineers, 1 backend engineer (4 weeks)

## 📍 What We Need From You
1. **Approve feature scope** - Does this align with product vision?
2. **Approve resource allocation** - Can we allocate 3 engineers for 4 weeks?
3. **Timeline confirmation** - Is Q2 2025 launch acceptable?
