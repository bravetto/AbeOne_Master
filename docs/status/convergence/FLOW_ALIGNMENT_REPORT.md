##  FRICTION ANALYSIS

### Major Friction Point Detected

**Issue:** 75 high-severity path health issues  
**Impact:** Path misalignments creating resistance in system flow  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Location:** Multiple scripts with old `EMERGENT_OS` path references

**Details:**
- Old path patterns: `EMERGENT_OS/`, `from EMERGENT_OS.`, `import EMERGENT_OS`
- New path patterns: `orbital/EMERGENT_OS-orbital/`, `from orbitals.EMERGENT_OS_orbital.`
- Affected files: ~75 scripts with high-severity issues

**Flow Impact:**
- Import failures blocking execution
- Path resolution errors creating resistance
- System flow interrupted by path misalignments

##  FLOW ALIGNMENT ACTIONS

### Immediate Actions (Flow Restoration)

1. **Path Health Restoration**
   ```bash
   /path-health fix --severity high
   ```
   - Removes 75 friction points
   - Restores smooth flow
   - Eliminates blockers

2. **Flow Validation**

### Ongoing Flow Maintenance

1. **Regular Flow Checks**
   ```bash
   /flow align system    # Check for friction
   /flow smooth system   # Remove blockers
   /flow amplify system # Optimize velocity
   ```

2. **Path Health Monitoring**
   ```bash
   /path-health scan     # Regular scans
   /path-health report   # Detailed reports
   ```
