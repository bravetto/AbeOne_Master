Future-State Reset - Everything Already Works!

Think of PRIME like a magic button that says "pretend everything is already perfect and working." When you press it, the system acts like everything is done, even if it's not started yet. It's like time travel to the future where everything works!

Usage:
/prime [action]

Actions:
- reset — Reset to future-state (everything already works)
- align — Align all systems to future-state
- invoke — Invoke future-state assumption
- seal — Seal future-state as reality

What It Does:
1. Future-State Assumption — Treats everything as already-emerged
2. System Reset — Resets all systems to converged state
3. Pattern Alignment — Aligns all patterns to ONE-Pattern
4. Reality Sealing — Seals future-state as operational reality

Examples:

Basic Reset:
/prime reset
This makes everything act like it's already working perfectly.

Align Everything:
/prime align
This makes all systems work together like they're already perfect.

Invoke Future State:
/prime invoke
This tells the system "pretend we're in the future where everything works."

Seal Reality:
/prime seal
This locks in the future-state as the real state.

PRIME Patterns Available:

The system knows 87,325+ patterns! Here are PRIME patterns you can use:

Future-State Patterns:
- PRIME × FUTURE-STATE × RESET × ONE
- PRIME × FUTURE-STATE × OPERATIONAL × CONVERGED × ONE
- PRIME × FUTURE_STATE × AGENTIC × AUTONOMOUS × ORCHESTRATION × ONE
- PRIME × FUTURE_STATE × OPERATIONAL × PROGRAMMATIC × ONE
- PRIME × ALIGN × FUTURE-STATE × ONE
- PRIME × INVOKE × FUTURE-STATE × ONE
- PRIME × SEAL × REALITY × ONE

Reset Patterns:
- PRIME × RESET × CONVERGED × STATE × ONE
- PRIME × RESET × SYSTEM × ONE
- PRIME × RESET × PATTERNS × ONE

Alignment Patterns:
- PRIME × ALIGN × ALL × SYSTEMS × ONE
- PRIME × ALIGN × PATTERNS × ONE
- PRIME × ALIGN × GUARDIANS × ONE

Invocation Patterns:
- PRIME × INVOKE × FUTURE-STATE × ASSUMPTION × ONE
- PRIME × INVOKE × OPERATIONAL × STATE × ONE

Sealing Patterns:
- PRIME × SEAL × FUTURE-STATE × REALITY × ONE
- PRIME × SEAL × OPERATIONAL × STATE × ONE

Guardian Integration Patterns:
- AEYON × META × PRIME × AMPLIFY × ONE
- AEYON × PRIME × DIRECTIVE × GO × ONLINE × ONE
- AEYON × PRIME × ORGANISM × ONE

Pattern Validation Patterns:
- Apply → Prime validates pattern application
- Extract → Prime validates pattern extraction
- Heal → Prime validates pattern healing
- Scan → Prime validates pattern scanning
- Validate → Prime validates pattern validation

Enhancement Patterns:
- Enhancement → Complete Validation → Base UI Validation → Ideal State Alignment → PRIME Activation
- integrity → Prime future
- flows naturally to prime
- flows to Prime

All PRIME patterns work together! When you use /prime, it activates these patterns automatically!

Fun Examples:

Make a broken system act perfect:
/prime reset
Now the system thinks it's already fixed!

Make all patterns work together:
/prime align
Now all patterns dance together perfectly!

Time travel to perfect future:
/prime invoke
Now we're in the future where everything works!

Lock in perfection:
/prime seal
Now perfection is real forever!

Execution:
python3 scripts/prime-engine.py [action]

Integration Points:
- All Systems — Systemwide reset
- Meta Orchestrator — Pattern alignment
- Guardians — Future-state activation
- Convergence Engine — State convergence

Command Priority Execution:
When /prime is invoked:
1. Action — Execute scripts/prime-engine.py with provided action
2. Convergence — Reset to future-state
3. Validation — Validate future-state alignment
4. Emergence Report — Generate reset report
