## 🔍 FRICTION POINTS IDENTIFIED

### Friction Point 1: Scattered Root-Level Documentation

**Issue:** 200+ markdown files at root level  
**Impact:** HIGH (difficult to navigate, find information)  
**Current State:** Documentation scattered across root  
**Smooth State:** Organized in `docs/` hierarchy  
**Velocity Impact:** -50% (navigation friction)

**Examples:**
- `AEYON_*.md` files (50+ files)
- `CONVERGENCE_*.md` files (20+ files)
- `ABEONE_*.md` files (30+ files)
- Various status/report files (100+ files)

---

### Friction Point 2: Multiple Organizational Patterns

**Issue:** Orbitals, Products, Folders use different patterns  
**Impact:** HIGH (unclear where things belong)  
**Current State:** Mixed organizational approaches  
**Smooth State:** Unified ONE Pattern organization  
**Velocity Impact:** -40% (decision friction)

**Patterns Found:**
- Orbital pattern: `*-orbital/` directories
- Product pattern: `PRODUCTS/` directory
- Folder pattern: `docs/`, `scripts/`, `config/`
- Legacy pattern: `_ARCHIVE/`, `archive/`

---

### Friction Point 3: Inconsistent Project Boundaries

**Issue:** Project boundaries unclear or inconsistent  
**Impact:** MEDIUM (drift detection difficult)  
**Current State:** Multiple boundary definitions  
**Smooth State:** Unified `.project-boundary` system  
**Velocity Impact:** -30% (boundary confusion)

**Boundary Definitions Found:**
- `.project-boundary` file (current)
- `PROJECT_MASTER_INDEX.md` (documentation)
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` (per-project)
- Orbital manifests (per-orbital)

---

### Friction Point 4: Product Location Inconsistency

**Issue:** Products in multiple locations  
**Impact:** MEDIUM (unclear product structure)  
**Current State:** Products in `PRODUCTS/`, `products/`, orbitals  
**Smooth State:** Unified product location  
**Velocity Impact:** -25% (location confusion)

**Product Locations:**
- `PRODUCTS/abebeats/` (organized)
- `products/apps/web/` (web products)
- `orbital/AbeBEATs_Clean-orbital/` (orbital)
- Mixed locations for other products

---

### Friction Point 5: Missing ONE Pattern Alignment

**Issue:** No unified ONE Pattern organizational strategy  
**Impact:** HIGH (no convergence framework)  
**Current State:** Multiple organizational attempts  
**Smooth State:** ONE Pattern-aligned organization  
**Velocity Impact:** -60% (no convergence path)

**ONE Pattern Requirements:**
- CLARITY → COHERENCE → CONVERGENCE → ELEGANCE → UNITY
- Current state: CLARITY (partial), COHERENCE (partial), CONVERGENCE (missing)
